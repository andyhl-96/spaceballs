# spaceballs
Physics simulator made for Boilermake 12. We use open3d for visualization and implement our own physics processes and collision system, which is heavily based on the Hamiltonian equations of motion. There is strong emphasis and support for static potential functions, and we support classical mechanical simulations as well as electromagnetic interactions. Spaceballs is a great way to gain an intuition of complex high dimensional Hamiltonian systems.
