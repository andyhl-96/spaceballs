# spaceballs
Spaceballs dynamics are derived from Hamiltonian equations of motion which allows for the incorporation and emphasis of potential and potential functions. One can enter an arbitrary static potential function depending on position, constants, mass, and electric charge. The model is able to simulate collisions based on a coefficient of restitution, allowing for elastic and inelastic collisions. Furthermore, one can populate a space of any number of particles to observe how the interact gravitationally, and electromagnetically. Spaceballs does well on small to medium sized systems and allows for insight into how such systems involve by observing motion of bodies in that system

We hope to improve Spaceballs to be a more general physics simulator, being able to handle not only balls, but other kinds of objects and collision geometry. We know Spaceballs is not intended to be used in high precision environments, but we believe it can be made into a valuable tool to observe how complex dynamical systems evolve. It allows for an easier time to develop an intuitive understanding of how such systems work.
